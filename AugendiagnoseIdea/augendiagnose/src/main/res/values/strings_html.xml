	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</h2>

	
	This App has the purpose to support the visualization of eye photographs on an Android device, in order to do medical
	diagnosis.

	<h3>Key Features</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Organization of eye photos by name, date and side (right/left)</li>

		<li>Display of two eye photos in parallel (with full support of individual resizing), so that comparisons are possible
			(such as right-left comparison, earlier-later comparison, different person comparison, or comparison to an iris
			topography).</li>

		<li>Change of brightness and contrast of the photo during display, and overlay with an iris topography.</li>

		<li>You can also save information in the photos, such as brightness adaptions and comments. To be able to store
			information and use the full functionality of the app, you need photos in JPG format.</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>Main activities</h3>

	<h4>Step 1: Organize the photos.</h4>

	<p>In this step, you can organize eye photos.</p>

	<p>The App expects new eye photos in an input folder. This folder is preconfigured as the target folder of the Eye-Fi
		app or as the default folder of the camera, but can be changed via the settings.</p>

	<p>In the &ldquo;Organize new photos&rdquo; activity, you can assign new eye photos from the input folder to a person
		and a date and prepare them in this way for the app. Then the photos will be renamed and moved to the eye photo
		folder.</p>

	<p>
		As further alternative, you may take pictures directly from the app with the device camera. This will normally not
		give photos in adequate quality, but it serves as an alternative to a professional camera, in particular if you use a
		macro lens such as the
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/irisocamera/iriso-english" target="_blank">Miniris-2</a>
		.
	</p>

	<p>As third alternative,</p>

	<h4>Step 2: Visualize the photos.</h4>

	<p>This is the main purpose of the app, but it requires the photos to be organized via step 1.</p>

	<p>In this activity, you can</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail. Here you can also change brightness and contrast of the photo, show iris
			topographies as overlay, or write a comment to a photo.</li>

		<li>Display two photos for comparison (and pinch them independently).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Trial period / In-App purchases</h3>

	<p>The app allows free use only for a trial period of two weeks. Further use requires the one-time purchase of an
		in-app package.</p>

	<h3>Windows application</h3>

	<p>
		There is an accompanying Windows application that can be used to view the photos that have been organized with this
		app. For more information, see
		<a href="http://augendiagnose.jeisfeld.de/?lang=en&page=windowsapp" target="_top">http://augendiagnose.jeisfeld.de/?page=windowsapp</a>
		.
	</p>

	<h3>Data storage</h3>

	<p>The app stores information (like iris position or comments) directly in the JPG image files. This has the advantage
		that all such information is still available if you copy the pictures from one device to another one. To some extent,
		information like comments will be even available when viewing the files in MS Windows.</p>

	<p>However, this kind of storage imposes a small risk. It may happen that on some devices, or for pictures from some
		cameras, storage of information in the JPG fails, or possibly even destroys the JPG file. Therefore, it is recommended
		that you keep backups of your JPG files at least when using the app for the first time with a new device or with a new
		camera.</p>

	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:
	<h3>Input Settings</h3>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Input folder for new eye photos</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">
				<p>This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this is either the target folder of
					the Eye-Fi app or the standard folder of the Camera app. However, you can configure here any other folder.</p>

				<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile device is not sufficient to capture eye
					photos in high quality. A more practical approach is to use an external camera with Eye-Fi SD card, which transfers
					the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Last photo is right eye</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default this is
				the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye and then of the left eye).</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h3>Display Settings</h3>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Sort by last name</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may decide that names are not ordered strictly alphabetically as given, but by
				the last name.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Guided setup of iris and pupil position</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may decide if you are guided through setting the iris and pupil position before
				you can display overlays.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Default overlay color</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can define the default color for iris topography overlays. (Standard: red)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Language</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can change the language in which the app is displayed. A value change forces a
				restart of the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Display all hints</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can re-enable all hints.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Do not display hints</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can disable all existing hints (which is helpful after new installation if you
				know the app already).</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h3>Storage and Memory Settings</h3>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Eye Photo Folder</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top"><p>This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you need not
					change this. From here, you can copy the photos to other devices.</p>

				<p>The predefined folder is &ldquo;EyePhotos&rdquo;.</p>

				<p>You can select here a folder either on your device memory or on an SD card. In Android 4.4 (Kitkat), storage on
					SD card has some limitations, therefore some operations will take longer. In Android 5, when selecting a folder on
					SD card, you will have to grant access rights to the SD card via Android&apos;s Storage Access Framework.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Max Bitmap size</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This downscaling is
				required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In devices with little memory, it may be required to
				configure a smaller value (such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Show image in full resolution</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can decide under which circumstances the photo is displayed in full resolution,
				which allows to see more details on the photo, but consumes memory and computing time.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Always load automatically:</b> The app always stores the photos in full resolution in memory. This gives the
						best user experience on high end devices, but may lead to crashes if there is not enough memory available.</li>

					<li><b>Load automatically when displaying single photo:</b> The app shows full resolution only when displaying a
						single image. This requires half of the memory.</li>

					<li><b>Load only on demand:</b> The app does not show the image in full resolution. This requires least memory and
						CPU, but details in the photo may be lost. The &ldquo;magnifier&rdquo; button <img
						src="../drawable/ic_clarity.png" /> allows to display the current picture detail in full resolution.</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Save additional data in jpeg</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Store in EXIF (recommended):</b> The app stores relevant information in the JPG file, even in standard
						fields which are visible in Windows.</li>

					<li><b>Store in custom fields:</b> The app stores information in the JPG file, but only in separate fields.
						Standard fields remain unchanged; the data exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

					<li><b>Don&apos;t store data in images:</b> The app does not store information in JPG files. (This limits the
						functionality of the app.)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Automatic detection of iris</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can select if the app should automatically try to find the position of iris and
				pupil in the eye photos. This typically will simplify the positioning of overlays, but it requires many resources of the
				phone, and the result may be incorrect.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h3>Camera Settings</h3>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Camera compatibility</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">If your device runs on Android 5 or higher, then here you can select if the camera
				functionality should use the new Android 5 features or not. Selection of &ldquo;Android 4&rdquo; makes sense in case
				of issues with Android 5 compatibility.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Enable flash</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may enable the flashlight functionality. By default, this is disabled, as it is
				dangerous to use the flashlight close to the eye.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Camera screen position</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">If the Miniris ribbon hides some buttons on the camera screen, then you can use this
				setting to shift the camera screen to the right or left.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h3>Overlay Button Configuration</h3>

	<p>This page allows you to define which iris topography overlays can be displayed by pressing the overlay buttons. The
		same setting can also be done while displaying the photos, by making a long click on some overlay button.</p>

	<h3>Premium Packs / Support</h3>

	<p>This page offers the possibility to purchase a premium pack which gives you unlimited access to all functions of the
		app.</p>

	<p>In addition, there are the following features:</p>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Remove Ads (only for users of older versions)</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can disable all ads (currently only in US). This feature can be enabled via
				donation or via user key.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Contact the developer</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can send an email to the developer in case you have wishes or problems.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">User key</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.</td>

	<h2>Organize the photos</h2>

	<p>Here you can organize your eye photos.</p>

	<p>The two last images of the input folder are displayed.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;Switch&rdquo; you can exchange the two photos.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;Other Photos&rdquo;, you can select two different photos from the input folder, by clicking
		on two of the displayed photos. Here, you may also delete photos from the input folder, by using the context menu
		(long click on a photo).</p>

	<p>At &ldquo;Select Name&rdquo; you can set the name of the person from which the eye photos are taken. Here you can
		either select an existing name or enter a new name.</p>

	<p>At &ldquo;Select Date&rdquo; you can select the date on which the photos are listed. Typically this is the capture
		date of the photos, which is preselected. However, you may select a different date. This is necessary in particular,
		if you want to keep more than one eye pair of a person from one date - the app allows only one photo pair per day and
		person.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;OK&rdquo; you can move the selected eye photo pair to the eye photo folder. The photos are
		attached to the given name and date and can then be used by the app.</p>

	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>Here you can select the name of a person whose eye photos you want to see. Then you get shown all eye photos of this
		person in a list sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo).</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person (via long click) and then select a photo of
			a different person.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos - this allows to compare eye photos with
		iris topography graphics. Such graphics are not included in the app (except as overlays).</p>

	<h3>Further options in the overview</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>When making a long click on a name in the list of names, you may change or delete the name</li>

		<li>When making a long click on a date in the list of pictures for a name, you may change the date or delete the
			pictures of that date, or you may
						move these pictures back to the input folder (e.g. in order to move them to a different name).
					</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Further options in the detail view</h3>

	<p>In the detail view (one or two photos), you have the following further possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Change of brightness and contrast via sliders <img src="../drawable/ic_seek_brightness.png" /><img
			src="../drawable/ic_seek_contrast.png" />, as well as change of saturation <img
			src="../drawable/ic_seek_saturation.png" /> and color temperature <img
			src="../drawable/ic_seek_color_temperature.png" /></li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Display of iris topographies as overlay (circle button <img src="../drawable/ic_btn_wheel.png" class="frameless" />
				and numbered buttons), adaption of the overlay to the iris and storage of overlay position (lock button <img
					src="../drawable/ic_lock_open.png" />)
			</p>
			<p>When making a long click on one of the numbered buttons, you can change the overlay for this button. For the last
				numbered button, this allows you also to remove the button or add another button.</p>
		</li>

		<li>Set the pupil size for the overlays (button <img src="../drawable/ic_btn_pupil_0.png" class="frameless" />). Here
			you can either keep the pupil centered (<img src="../drawable/ic_btn_pupil_1.png" class="frameless" />) or move it
			freely (<img src="../drawable/ic_btn_pupil_2.png" class="frameless" />).
		</li>

		<li>Store the selected settings of brightness and contrast (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; <img
			src="../drawable/ic_action_save.png" /> button on action bar)
		</li>

		<li>Store the position and zoom (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_action_save.png" /> button on action
			bar)
		</li>

		<li>Change the comment of the photo (via &ldquo;document&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_comment.png" /> button on
			action bar)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These features may be enabled or disabled via the button &ldquo;Show/Hide utilities&rdquo; (<img
			src="../drawable/ic_tools_up.png" /> <img src="../drawable/ic_tools_down.png" /> <img
			src="../drawable/ic_tools_left.png" /> <img src="../drawable/ic_tools_right.png" />).
